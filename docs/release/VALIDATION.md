# Validation record

Reproducible commands and pointers to compact raw evidence for the release
candidate. Every result names the revision it was produced at. Evidence
produced by simulators is labelled as such; nothing here is a physical
measurement unless the row says `device`.

## Environment (this server)

```sh
cd /work/shared/users/phd/nz264/spmw-for-pim/experiments/allo
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH
PY=/work/zhang-capra/users/nz264/miniforge3/envs/spmw/bin/python   # Python 3.12, numpy 2.3.5, pytest 9.1.1
```

`allo/_mlir` is a symlink into `mlir/build/tools/allo/_mlir` (built against
`/work/shared/common/llvm-project-main/build-rhel8`); `externals/llvm-project`
is not checked out here, so `LLVM_BUILD_DIR` is not needed for the Python
path but some tests read it. Simulator discovery (`allo/spmw_simenv.py`):
Samsung `experiments/simulators/PIMSimulator/pim_driver`, AiM docker image
`aim-simulator-build` + `experiments/simulators/aim_simulator/test/example.yaml`,
UPMEM provenance under `~/shared/tenon-artifacts/upmem/provenance/upimulator`
+ docker image `bongjoonhyun/upimulator`. All four reported available on
2026-11-01. APU v1 board: PCI vendor `0x1e4c` at `0000:41:00.0`, toolchain
`/usr/local/gsi-apu/13.7.1`, GVML headers `/usr/local/include/gsi`.

## Baseline at 8160d6d (before repairs), 2026-11-01

| Suite | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| PIM (no paper golden, no APU device row) | `$PY -m pytest tests/pim -q -p no:cacheprovider --deselect tests/pim/test_paper_golden.py -rs` | 88 passed, 13 skipped (paper_full), 56 deselected, 331 s; includes `test_gemv_apu_v1` on the board |
| perf | `$PY -m pytest tests/perf -q -p no:cacheprovider -m "not apu_v1_device"` | 96 passed |
| upstream smoke | `tests/test_builder.py tests/test_types.py tests/test_linalg.py` | 124 passed, 2 skipped (packaging audit run); a later run of a wider upstream set shows 4 pre-existing failures (`test_slice`, `test_bf16_array`, `test_concatenate[True/False]`: `RuntimeError: Unknown function slice`) that reproduce identically on a pristine `8160d6d` worktree |

## After repair increment 1 (uncommitted at the time of the run; see STATUS.md for the commit)

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| perf (`-m "not apu_v1_device"`) | 112 passed, 93 s |
| upstream smoke (`test_builder test_types test_linalg test_c_backend test_bitop test_popcount test_static_slice`) | 154 passed, 2 skipped, 4 failed (the same 4 pre-existing failures) |
| PIM (no paper golden, no APU device row) | see STATUS.md (run in progress when this file was written; one expected failure `test_gemv_upmem` fixed by updating its expected exception) |
| AiM `paper_full` CENT rows | 11 passed; all 14 CENT traces byte-identical to pinned SHA-256; golden cycles 11,750 / 129,605 / 11,010 / 6,307 reproduce (`fix-aim-axes` agent run) |
| UPMEM `paper_full` golden rows | 13 passed, pinned cycles unchanged (`fix-upmem-dtypes` agent run) |

## Probe evidence (audit stage)

Probe scripts and logs are kept under `/tmp/tenon-release/probes/<area>/` on
this server (not part of the release). The audit files under `audit/` quote
the executed outputs. Key executed observations at `8160d6d`:

- Samsung: forcing `bank_row`, `grf_staged`, `dual_fiber+per_workid+wresident`
  changed `compiled.cmds` (4/6/768 commands) but not argv, CRF, cycles (4435)
  or output bytes; `x = 0, y = 1` returned no outputs and left `y = 1`;
  `acc: f16 = 0.5` returned `W@x`.
- AiM: GEMV spelled `W[ch*ROWS+i, j]` issued 8 MAC_ABK vs 1 for the `row0`
  spelling (simulated 858 vs 222 cycles); 96x256 with mapping [3] issued 341x
  the logical MACs.
- UPMEM: `gemv-int64` ran "successfully" with int32-wrapped results; a
  k-means update with a wide shift returned zeros.
- Gemini-II source route: empty `main()`, `RunResult(cycles=None)`, output
  untouched.
- APU v1: `backend="virtual"` on `APUv1Program` hit the device gate.

## Round 2 device evidence (2026-11-02)

### Gemini-II on zhang-x4 (raw logs: `/work/shared/users/phd/nz264/tenon-release-evidence/g2/`)

Environment: host `en-ec-zhang-x4`, card `apu-00` PCI 0000:61:00.0, FW
`GSI_G2_Infrastructure_V1.24.1`, Status Available, 4 cores idle; SDK
`/opt/gsi` (`gsi_tool` at `/opt/gsi/g2/bin/amd64`); interpreter
`/work/shared/users/phd/nz264/anaconda3/envs/allo-dev/bin/python` (3.12.12,
numpy 2.4.3); the checkout is the same shared working tree as this server
(`ffb4a78` plus the uncommitted wave 2 tree, 59 dirty paths at run time);
every launch wrapped in `flock /tmp/tenon-apu-g2.lock` on the device host.
Scripts: `step2_3.sh`, `step4.sh` in the evidence directory.

| Step | Program | kind | cycles (ticks per call, batch of 20) | Check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| software gates | `tests/perf/test_apu_g2_typed_program.py`, `test_apu_g2_composed_contraction.py`, `test_apu_g2_target_layout.py` | | | 13 passed |
| 2 | `run_apu_g2_u16_add` (4 x 65536 u16) | device | 236 (pipeline 4,710 raw ticks / 20) | outputs returned, exact |
| 3 | typed add i16+i16->i16 | device | 333 | exact (runtime oracle) |
| 3 | typed mul i8*i8->i16 | device | 312 | exact |
| 3 | typed div u16/u16->u16 | device | 1,019 | exact |
| 3 | typed block_sum u8->u16, K=256 | device | 2,614 | exact |
| 3 | typed dot i4.i4->i15, 1985x128 | device | 1,713 | exact |
| 4 | composed GEMM INT4 64x128x31 | device | 1,711 (paper median 1,733) | exact |
| 4 | composed batched GEMM INT4 4x32x128x16 | device | 1,720 (1,739) | exact |
| 4 | composed GESUMMV INT2 M1024 K128 | device | 1,876 (1,860) | exact |
| 4 | composed BiCG INT3 N256 | device | 2,569 (2,549) | exact |
| 4 | composed MVT INT3 N256 | device | 2,754 (2,767) | exact |

"exact" means the runtime's int64 NumPy oracle comparison passed on the
device readback (the runtime raises otherwise; device values are what is
returned). Cycles are device ARC running-state ticks per call, never host
time; host h2d/d2h/end-to-end microseconds are in the logs separately. The
device library sha256 for all step 4 runs is
`8ea3600c0a60ccc78dd2d1a9f8d1fd9b71ee05912e4f9d5f208d45331a57ffc5`. The
paper medians are listed for orientation only; they were not a pass
criterion. Negative controls (step 5 of `audit/apu-g2.md`) have not been
run yet.

### APU v1 on this server (raw logs: `/work/shared/users/phd/nz264/tenon-release-evidence/apuv1/`)

First post-repair device run (`w2-device-tests.log`): 4 failed, all with the
new profile-freshness check reporting ~2,058 `total` records: each
`ledag-ssh` session's `flo` prints the whole retained device log, so a
"drain before, read after" scheme sees every historical record. Repaired by
diffing the log read before the launch against the log read after it
(`allo.pim.apu_v1_program.fresh_profile_records`). Second run:
`w2-device-tests-2.log` (result recorded in STATUS.md when complete).
